# Galaga
A clone of the arcade game Galaga written in Python with the Pygame library. 
Much inspiration for organization of code was taken from this repo: <https://github.com/Hyungmook/MarioLevel1>.

The github repo is at [github.com/ihalseide/Galaga](https://github.com/ihalseide/Galaga).

# Note:
Progress on Galaga is paused right now because of the huge amount of work it would take to put in all of the levels. There are 256 levels.

## How to run
Use Python to run the galaga.py file in the top-level directory.

Run `python galaga.py` in terminal, making sure all the dependencies for Python are met.

## Dependencies
